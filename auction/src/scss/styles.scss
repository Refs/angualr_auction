// src/sass/styles.scss

// If you have a SCSS or Sass file that you want to import but don't want to compile to a CSS file, you can add an underscore to the beginning of the filename. This will tell Sass not to compile it to a normal CSS file. You can then import these files without using the underscore.

// For example, you might have _colors.scss. Then no _colors.css file would be created, and you can do

@import './variables';
@import './mixins';
@import './metas';
@import '../../node_modules/bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/_bootstrap.scss';
